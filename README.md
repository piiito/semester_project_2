# Art Vandelay website
This is a website for auction house.
        
## Description
In this project I set out to create a website for an auction house named Art Vandelay focusing on young artists and collectors. The design is ment to let the artwork shine, but also appeal to a younger audience. This project has given me a deeper understanding of the works of Bootstrap, and also given me more insight in JavaScript and APIs.
